## Overview
  Compared to my first project, my workflow in this one seemed more natural as I had to do less searching up or looking through my notes.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Create a website as close as possible to the one provided in the screenshots inside the design folder

## My process
  After I created the HTML skeleton I started writing CSS from the outside to the inside and from top to bottom based on the screenshots in the design folder
  I did not manage to get all the properties from the get go so I had to do quite a lot of backtracking but because of the decent HTML skeleton, in my opinion, it wasn't hard to find my way around.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I still need more practice with the display attribute flexbox, absolute and relative. Another area that i need to realy explore is class reusability i think I did a very poor job of reusing classes.

### Useful resources

- [.nft-display hover state](https://youtu.be/neuRRdAqlVY?t=722) - This helped me to realize i can you display: relative and absolute to achieve what I wanted. After seeing that i didn't watch further and was able to do it on my own.

## Acknowledgments

- [.nft-display hover state](https://youtu.be/neuRRdAqlVY?t=722) - A huge shoutout to the guy who made this video, as i didn't do anyting similar with hover state overlay up until now and I was stuck for over an hour before using his method.
- [.nft-display focus state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4358316/how-to-change-anchor-color-when-you-hover-over-a-list) - Didn't realize how to make the animation appear on focus as it was focusing on the a element not on the .color-overlay div itself.
